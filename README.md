The "About Me" page will consist of facts about myself both personal and school related. The page will be built from the wireframe and will be neat. The links will be clearly visible. Links will consist of: CodePen, Github, LinkedIn, projects, school website, and the course page. Very important links will be in the nav bar and the footer consisting of a link to my repo and a link to validate the page. Links will work successfully and will direct the user to the correct site. The page will also consist of a box (The Course Page Box) and will be able to be dragged around by the user.
